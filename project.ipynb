    "# Analyzing Factors Affecting Running Performance \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to explore how different variables may affect running performance in various track events, especially for marathons. The main variables we are analyzing include nationality, age, and environmental conditions, like temperature. Here are our main research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Does temperature affect marathon performance? Increase or decrease in finish time?**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - To answer this, we decided to use a dataset from the Berlin Marathon containing all of the finishing times and the average temperature on each raceday from 1974 to 2019. After creating an area chart and scatterplot & regression model displaying the average temperature and average runtimes for each year of the Berlin marathon, we agree with the assumption that temperature does indeed make a difference in performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Are certain nationalities consistently dominant in specific track events?**\n",
    "    - To answer this, we created a several heatmaps from the olympic track results containing each athlete's nationality, event, and gender. From the heatmaps, we can see that the United States is the most dominant in track events, but usually this is because they have participated for a long time in the olympics and have sent a larger amount of athletes due to other nations. However, proportionately, we cannot definitively determine if certain nations are significantly better than others. However, athletes of African nationality are known to produce very good track athletes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Have average finish times for marathons and ultra-marathons improved significantly over the decades? How much?**\n",
    "    - To answer this, we created a line plot in Altair from the Ultramarathon events data containing each athlete's event, event year, and performance. After creating the line plot, we have seen that there is a slight increase for each long distance running event over time. However, because there is so much fluctuation still, we cannot definitievly conclude improvement in racetimes over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Does peak performance age vary based on event type (short vs. long distance events)?**\n",
    "   - To answer this, we created a line plot in altair from the olympic sport events data containing each athlete's event and age. After creating the bar plots for each gender, we have seen that shorter events have an average younger athlete age than longer distance events like the marathon."

    "### Q1 - Does Temperature Affect Running Performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- So for this question, we created an area map and a scatter plot to help better visualize the affect of temperature on the Berlin Marathon running performance times. Again, we used the Berlin marathon data from 1974-2019. We decided to use the Berlin Marathon Dataset because it included data on raceday temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the results, we assume that temperature does indeed make a difference in affecting running performances. It does make logical sense that the hotter it gets, the harder it is to run.\n",
    "    1. Let's first examine the area chart below: In this chart you can see blue -- representing the average time in seconds to complete the marathon for a certain year and also orange -- representing the average temperature on the day of the race. Lastly, the red dotted line represents the average time to complete the marathon across all the years of the data. Looking at the data here, we can see that when temperature goes up, the time it takes to finish also generally tends to rise as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Next, let's look at the scatter plot. The regression line we calculated was **TIME_SECONDS = 91.69 * AVG_TEMP_C + 12907.67**. This shows that there is a slight positive slope and further shows that there is likely a relationship between the two. "

    "- To answer this question, we used our ultramarathon track events dataset, containing tens of thousands of different athletes competing in a wice variety of different ultramarathon events.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. From our results in our line plot, we do see that there is a slight decrease in performance (the times got higher). However, this definitiely does not allow us to say that performance has data in the earlier years of the data. In contrast to the data, we believe that with a increease in better training standards and sports technologies, people are aactually in fact running these events faster than previously before."

    "### Q4 - Does peak performance age vary based on event type (short vs. long distance)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To answer this question, we used our Olympic Sports Events (not track specific) data set because it included each athlete's ages. We filtered out the data for only track events and the athletes that won a medal. Then we created two bar plots showing the average age of athletes per Olympic track event, one for each gender of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Looking at the two different bar plots, we can see that the shorter distance events for both genders have younger athletes. From this, we can generally assume that younger athletes are more explosive and better suited for short-distance events that require fast-twitch muscle power and brute force. However, for longer distance events like the marathon, the average age is higher. This shows that older athletes are still perfectly capable of performing at an elite level at an older age. It shows that age is less importantof a success factor for longer events. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. A graph that we were not able to create was the distribution of race times per track event per age. I wasn't able to do this because I coldn't quite merge my other Olympic dataset togehter with this one. The other one had the race times, but this one had the athlete ages. After some difficulties, I was unfortunately unable to create such a graph comibining both age and time variables. "

    "    1. Variation Across Events: Peak performance age varies between track events. Sprinters (100m, 200m) often peak in their mid-20s, while marathoners and ultra-marathoners typically peak later, in their 30s. The average across all events could obscure these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Exclusion of Other Factors: The analysis focuses only on age, ignoring factors like injury history, training, and nutrition. These impact when athletes peak, especially in endurance sports like marathons and ultra-marathons.\n",

    "    3. Some athletes, especially in endurance events, may peak later and have longer careers. This analysis doesn’t consider how long athletes can perform at high levels, especially in marathons and ultra-marathons."
