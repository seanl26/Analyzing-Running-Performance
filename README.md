# Analyzing-Running-Performance
 This project is the final project for my Intermediate Data Programming Class (CSE163). This project explores the different factors potentially affecting marathon and track performance, such as age, temperature, and nationality.

Please note that I have one more dataset, called TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv (ultramarathon races) that was too big to be included in this repo but can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/code
